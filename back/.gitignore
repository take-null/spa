# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor

#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
spa/back/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
spa/back/log/*
spa/back/tmp/*
!spa/back/log/.keep
!spa/back/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
spa/back/tmp/pids/*
!spa/back/tmp/pids/
!spa/back/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
spa/back/storage/*
!spa/back/storage/.keep
spa/back/tmp/storage/*
!spa/back/tmp/storage/
!spa/back/tmp/storage/.keep
